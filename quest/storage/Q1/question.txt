Create a PersistentVolume

Create a PersistentVolume called host-storage-pv. Configure this PersistentVolume so that volumes that use it can be expanded in the future.
Note: This may require you to create additional objects.

Configure the PersistentVolume to use a hostPath for storage, located at /etc/data.

Configure the PersistentVolumes so that it can be automatically reused if all claims are deleted.

Create a Pod That Uses the `PersistentVolume` for Storage

Create a pod called pv-pod in the auth Namespace. Configure this Pod so that it uses the host-storage-pv PersistentVolume for storage.

Note: This will require the creation of a PersistentVolumeClaim.

Name the PersistentVolumeClaim host-storage-pvc. Give your PersistentVolumeClaim a size of 100Mi.

Use the busybox image for this pod, and configure it to run the command sh -c while true; do echo success > /output/output.log; sleep 5; done.
Mount the volume that uses the PersistentVolume for storage, such that the /output directory ultimately writes to the PersistentVolume.

Expand the `PersistentVolumeClaim`
Expand the PersistentVolumeClaim so that the requested storage size is 200Mi.
